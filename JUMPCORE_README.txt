ABOUT LICENSING

This directory contains files by various authors and under various licenses. However all licenses are BSD-style or weaker, and all licenses are GPL compatible. (The one exception to GPL compatibility is the Android support code, which is Apache 2 licensed and therefore compatible with GPL3 but not GPL2; the included Droid Sans font is also Apache 2, but since on non-Android platforms the font is an aggregated file, not something linked in, the GPL would allow this).

Anything original of mine in here is provided under an MIT license, as found in "desktop/README.txt", which basically just says source or binary redistributions have to preserve a certain copyright notice.

There is a sample "desktop/README.txt" included which contains the notices and license information for all included code. If you package this README.txt along with your program (the Windows and Linux makefiles do this automatically) you will have satisfied all your license obligations.

You can find the mac build files under desktop/; windows under desktop/win/; linux under desktop/lin/; iPhone under iPhone/; and android under android/. You can also find full documentation for Jumpcore at https://bitbucket.org/runhello/jumpcore/wiki/Home
